    <div id="bio"><p>Technology has always been a driving force in my life.  At the age of 14, I was licensed as an Amateur Radio Operator spending an entire summer studying for the tests.  Radio began to tug at my soul and I started experimenting with scanners and understanding  frequency allocations and what behaviors those frequency ranges had and why they were being used for any given application. 
      By 15 I was able to land a "conversation" with Norman Thagard during his time on the Russian MIR Space Station. It wasn’t until my mid 20’s after a short career in the Marine Corps as an Air Traffic Controller when I was given the chance to work on satellite communications for the Williamson County Ham Radio Club annual field day event. 
      Coding always seemed over my head.  While working with Waste Management I was introduced to a scripting language, PSL (Post Scripting Language).  I was able to teach myself some basic concepts and in return produced a lot of in-house complex scripts.  Some of them worked more like programs and were pages long (GitHub). 
      From there I began working with Python and some C/C++ via the Arduino platform.  I am currently working with Node.js and automation through multiple IOT projects. </p></div>
